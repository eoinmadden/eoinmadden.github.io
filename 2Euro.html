	  <b><a href="https://www.eoinmadden.ie/">Eoin Madden</a></b>
	  has called for a €2 90-Minute fare for the greater Galway
	  region, including <b>Oranmore</b>.
	</p>

  <p>Commuters in county Galway are missing out on a great saving that
  is currently only available in Cork and Dublin which is that you can
  combine train and bus journeys into one fare using a Leap Card, and
  provided your final journey started within 90 minutes of your first,
    you only pay €2.
    <p>


    <p>"<em>As a regular train and bus user myself, I’ve raised with
    TFI and BusConnect that commuters in Oranmore and Athenry ought to
    be able to benefit from this fare. I know BusConnects aim to
    deliver a bus every 15 minutes from Oranmore to Galway, but I’m
    calling on TFI to examine pricing also</em>", says Green Party
      Candidate for Athenry Oranmore, Eoin Madden.</p>

	<p>"<em>Currently the fare from Oranmore to Galway on the
	train will cost you €3.65 one-way, and that’s before you might
	get a bus from Eyre Square to your destination. While this is
	a significant improvement, thanks to the reductions introduced
	by Eamon Ryan in April 2022, the offering needs to improve
	    further."</em>
	</p>

	<p>"<em>In Dublin you can travel from somewhere like Maynooth
	to Dublin city centre by train or bus, and then take another
	train or bus within the greater Dublin area, all for just two
	euros with a Leap Card. I’ve used this personally, travelling
	from Heuston Station to visit my brother in Ashtown, using a
	combination of Luas and Bus. It is handy and it is great
	    value.</em>"</p>
	

	<p><em>"I believe there is no single silver bullet to solve
	the traffic chaos in Galway, rather the solution will be a
	combination of better traffic management, increased public
	transport frequency, new bus routes, a Claregalway bypass and
	safer cycling routes. The current traffic during busy times
	is  a constant reminder of a legacy of poor spatial planning
	and previous lack of investment in transport</em>", says
	Mr. Madden. "<em>We can’t expect everyone to use public transport,
	but equally we shouldn’t force every young person into car
	    ownership.</em>"</p>
	  

	<p>"I’ve no doubt that introducing a 90-minute flat fare for two euros
	  across commuter rail and bus would be very welcome in Galway",
	says Eoin. "It has proven a success in Dublin and it is time we
	  got a fair shake here in the Galway commuter belt as well".</p>
