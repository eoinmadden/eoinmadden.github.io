	<p>
Loneliness has become a serious problem in Ireland. We have the
highest reported rate of loneliness in Europe with as many as one in
five saying they regularly experience it. When we hear about
loneliness we first think of this affecting older men, but
surprisingly, it's younger people as well as older ones who suffer in
this country. Eoin Madden, Green party candidate for the
Athenry-Oranmore LEA
says he passionately believes that a core responsibility of the
council to provide adequate community spaces. 
	</p>
	

	<p>
	  Loneliness is not simply just being alone. It is a complex
	  emotional response to a lack of meaningful social
	  connections. Galway senator, Pauline O’Reilly, recently
	  brought a bill to the Seanad on the topic of loneliness and
	  has described it as an epidemic.
	</p>
	

<p>Social connections do not just happen by accident. Local planning
  and development put structures in place that enable people to meet,
  socialise and bring others into parts of their lives.
</p>

	<p>Experts who study this talk about the importance of what
	  they call "<em>third spaces</em>".
	  If your home is your first space, and your place of work or
	  education is your second,
	  the <em>third spaces</em> are all the others where people
	  can voluntarily interact. Traditionally the pub and church
	  were important third spaces in Ireland, but these institutions are falling out of popularity so we have to see what new spaces can be provided.
	</p>
	  

<p>Local sports clubs can provide a great way for people to build up
  those connections, and we should support them, but they are not for
  everyone.
</p>

<p>
  Youth clubs can provide opportunities for young people to develop,
  but they need funding and enthusiastic volunteers. In a rural
  community it is often the same volunteers who are training kids in
  soccer, taking part in tidy towns and raising money for the
  school. Eoin Madden says “<em>With people working longer hours and
  commuting further, and so many distractions on TV and phones, some
  people feel they have less opportunity to spend time in the
  community. But I believe a core part of the Green message is that
  materialism doesn’t buy happiness, rather it is human connection and
    a sense of purpose that brings resilient contentment</em>.”</p>

<p>
  “<em>I am not naturally sporty, but I have really enjoyed helping to
  coach children at my local hurling club. My talents lie in computers
  so I became a coach at CoderDojo Athenry. CoderDojo is a coding
  club, free to join, where kids can learn to express their creativity
  and problem solve using computer code. We find it particularly suits
    children who may be neurodiverse."</em>
  
<p>"<em>I'm also heavily involved in Killimordaly playground, where we
recently installed new equipment, fencing and a bike rack. My hope in
the future is to add gymnastic equipment suitable for teenagers and
provide facilities for teens to “hang out” safely and where they
    aren't under pressure to buy junk food or alcohol</em>", continues
  Mr. Madden.</p>

<p>
“<em>There are fewer supports in place for older people, although
    libraries and community halls continue to provide valuable meeting
    places and their place in communities should never be taken for
    granted. We should be mindful in the coming elections that some
    far right candidates have been openly hostile to librarians. I
    will always support the wonderful work librarians do in sourcing
    books appropriate to their audience. This was invaluable during
    Covid lockdowns</em>”.
</p>


<p>
International research has shown that chronic loneliness can have
grave implications for people's physical and mental health. Finding
activities to which people can contribute, in the third spaces we
create as a community is key to tackling this silent epidemic and
putting much-needed social interaction back into so many people's
lives.
</p>

<p>
  Eoin says, “<em>I feel nobody else is talking about 3rd spaces, but
  I’m asking voters to make libraries, community halls, sheds and
  playgrounds a priority in the next election. This is an area where
  local councillors have a role to play in taking concrete action to
  build communities with strong bonds and resilient mental
    health.</em>”
