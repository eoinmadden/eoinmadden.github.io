	<p>Over the past few weeks, Irish Rail has installed new signage
	  around <b>Attymon station</b> and a biodiversity enhancements such an
	  “insect hotel”. This week, Irish Rail have applied for planning
	      permission for works to secure the roof.
	      The station has no working office now; what remains is a beautiful,
	      but derelict, red brick building from the 1890’s.
	      <br/>
	      line to the Attymon-Loughrea branch line.
	      This branch line closed in 1975. Today the red brick waiting room is
	      boarded up and fenced off.
	      <br/>
	      The unmanned station has a ticket machine, and is in  daily use.
	      There are 4 daily services to Galway, and 5 to Dublin.

	    <p>Local Green Party candidate,
	      <b><a href="https://eoinmadden.ie">Eoin
		  Madden</a></b> is a frequent user of the service:
	      <quote>
		"<em>Thanks to the fare reductions in
		  April 2022, a trip from Attymon to
		  Galway now costs under a fiver and
		  parking there is free. Its a great
			      service; I use the train from Attymon
			      and Athenry frequently for my work in
			      Galway. Its more convenient and less
			      stressful than driving into town and
			      finding parking. Of course the emissions
			      are significantly lower too. We can’t
			      expect every car journey to switch to
			      public transport, but the government
			      needs to have in place the
			      infrastructure and prices so that the
			      occasional journey by public transport
				becomes possible.</em>".

	    <p>“<em>From a heritage point of view, I welcome the news that Irish Rail are seeking to secure the roof of the 19th century waiting room, it would be shame to see the building crumble away beyond repair. Maybe in the future it can be converted to a community space or a house</em>”.</p>

	    <p>Last year, Irish Rail, added some biodiversity enhancements, such a
	      wildflower bed and an insect hotel. And insect hotel is a small
	      structure that allows solitary bees and other native insects nooks
	      and crannies to nest in. Often in our quest to make places look neat
	      and tidy we forget to leave a space for nature, such as a leaf pile
	      or some rotting wood; an insect hotel is a way to do this but still
	      make sure a garden doesn’t look neglected.
