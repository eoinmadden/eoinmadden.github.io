	<p>
	  Today Irish Rail have proposed to begin 7 new services to commence in October. Highlights include
	  <ul>
	    <li>5 more services stopping at Oranmore and Athenry</li>
	    <li>1 more service stopping at Attymon</li>
	    <li>An extra train for commuters in the morning into
	    Galway, probably leaving Attymon 08:28, Athenry 08:38,
	      Oranmore 08:48 approx)</li>
	    <li>An extra train in the evening into Galway, probably
	      leaving Athenry 22:46.</li>
	    <li>An extra early morning and extra mid morning train to Dublin
	    </li>
	    
	    <li>One new service on Sunday</li>

	  </ul>
	</p>
	 
<p>Eoin says: "<em>I see this as a result of the record funding the
	      Greens have secured for public transport when we entered
	      government. The car will remain the dominant form of
	      motorised transport, particularly in rural Ireland, but
	      I passionately believe people deserve to have more
	      transport options.</em>"
</p>	      


	<p>Irish Rail have today (May 30th, 2024) proposed 7 new services
	  serving Galway city and county.
	</p>

	
	<h3>Monday - Saturday:</h3>
	<ul>  
	    <li>New 07:27 hrs Tullamore/Galway service (Mon-Fri)
arriving at 08:58 hrs.<br/>  This provides an additional morning peak
service into Galway for all stations between Tullamore and
Oranmore. This is likely to leave Athenry at 08:38, and  Attymon at
	      08:28.
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      New 09:05 hrs Galway/Heuston (Mon-Fri) serving Oranmore,
	      Athenry, Ballinasloe, Athlone, Clara, Tullamore &
	      Portarlington, arriving into Dublin Heuston at 11:29
	      hrs.
	    </li>

	    <li>
There is currently a train at 09:30 from Galway to Heuston. Instead there would be one train at 09:05 and another at 10:05. Both would stop at Oranmore.
	    </li>
	    

	    <li>
	      New 05:45 hrs Heuston/Galway service (Mon-Fri) arriving
	      at 08:36 hrs. This gives a pre-09:00 arrival into Galway
	      City from Dublin.
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      New 20:30 hrs Heuston/Galway service (Mon-Sat) arriving
	      at 23:06 hrs. This will provide a later last service
	      from Dublin to Tullamore, Clara, Athlone, Ballinasloe,
	      Woodlawn, Athenry, Oranmore & Galway. The last train
	      from Athenry to Galway is currently 21:40, now there 
	      would be this new service at 22:46.
	    </li>


	    <p>New 20:50 hrs Galway/Heuston service (Mon-Sat) arriving
	    at 23:33 hrs. This will provide a later last service from
	    Galway to Clara, Tullamore, Portarlington, Kildare,
	    Newbridge & Heuston. Currently the last train from Galway
	    to Dublin is at 19:20. This later service is
	      welcome. Although we really need one later than 22:20.
	    </p>
	</ul>

	<h3>Sundays</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>
New 10:30 hrs Heuston/Galway (Sundays) service arriving at 13:02 hrs, also calling at Newbridge, Kildare, Portarlington, Tullamore, Clara, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Woodlawn, Athenry & Oranmore.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    New 13:40 hrs Galway/Heuston (Sundays) service arriving at
	    16:14 hrs, also calling at Oranmore, Athenry, Attymon,
	    Woodlawn, Ballinasloe, Athlone, Clara, Tullamore &
	    Portarlington.The current service leaving Galway at 13:00
	    would change to leave at the earlier time of 12:20. This 
	    new service would leave Galway at 13:40. The earlier train
	    will serve Attymon but the later one won't.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>The announcement today is enabled by the recent acquisition
	of new carriages and the Greens winning a ratio of 2:1
	spending on public transport versus private transport when
	entering government. Some parties want to force young people
	into expensive car ownership but the Greens believe in giving
	  transport options.</p>


<p>Today is good news for rail commuters in Galway city and county.
