	  The EU elections on Friday are of global significance. How
	  you use your vote in Galway sends a signal to the world.</p>

	<p>If you are concerned about the ongoing genocide in Gaza, I
	  ask you to
	  vote Number 1 for <b>Senator Pauline O'Reilly</b> as the
	  Midlands–North-West  MEP.
	  Last month, she wrote a joint letter With MEPs Ciarán Cuffe
	  and Grace
	  O'Sullivan <a href="https://www.greenparty.ie/news/open-letter-ursula-von-der-leyen-irish-green-meps-candidates">urging
	    President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen,
	    to take action to protect civilians.</a>
	</p>

	<p>Since the, von
	der Leyen has taken no action, and continues to support
	Israel, and promising the 
	  EU’s "unconditional support" to Israel.
	</p>


	<p> Ursula von der Leyen is seeking re-election President of the EU
	Commission, the most powerful political role in the EU. She
	  does so with the support of the European People's Party, to
	which Fine Gael belongs.
	  If you vote for Maria Walsh or Nina Carberry, you are voting
	for  Ursula von 
	  der Leyen having a second term in
	  the most powerful political role in the EU. Many people
	believe her promise of the EU’s "unconditional
	  support" of to Israel exceeded her
	  responsibilities as President of the Commission and was
	  inappropriate.
	</p>

	<p>
Since then the ICJ has said the claim of genocide in Gaza is
plausible.
</p>

<p>Ireland is committed to peace in the Middle East through immediate
  ceasefires on both sides and work towards two state solution. The
  government recognise Israel and Palestine and want both sides to
  cease hostilities. I condemn Hamas utterly. <p>

<p>My belief is that reelecting Ursula Von Der Leyen as President of the
  EU Commission is not consistent with the aim of peace. If you agree,
  I  ask you  to carefully consider how best to use your vote.
