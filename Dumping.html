	  <b><a href="https://www.eoinmadden.ie/">Eoin Madden</a></b>,
	  Green Party candidate in Oranmore-Athenry says he has been
	  receiving many calls and emails regarding scandalous illegal
	  dumping and pollution in general.</p>
	  

	<quote>"Over the past few months, I’ve been contacted by
	numerous residents in Caherroyan  who were living with foul
	smelling wastewater flowing into their estate. I contacted the
	county council Environment section and I identified the
	company who were working on a site nearby. There was a foul
	odour and grey water, from an adjacent site, which was seen
	pooling in the green area of the estate. Parents were telling
	their children not to play outside. The waste was also flowing
	along the tarmac, leaving its smell and grey residue in the
	parking area. It was most unpleasant for the residents to have
	  to live with."
	</quote>

	<p><quote>"I understand that the environment section of Galway
	County Council have taken action in early May. The situation
	  is now much improved and the tarmac has been powerwashed".
	</quote>
	<p>

	<p><quote>"Similarly, I’ve been contacted by residents near
	Claregalway who say heavy sludge, not ordinary farm slurry,
	was spread some weeks ago on land near the River Clare. Any of
	us living in the countryside are used to slurry being spread a
	couple of times in a year. Its part of rural life. But this
	sludge was something different. People are worried about the
	health effects for those living close by, but also the effect
	on the River Clare. 
We want to build a river walk along River Clare, how can this work though if the river is treated almost like a sewer?"
	</quote></p>

	<p><quote>"On a positive note, I’m happy to hear that two
	fines, each for €150, were issued recently for dumping which
	happened in Kiltullagh by persons from well outside the
	area. I coordinated the recent Kiltullagh Killimordaly Spring
	Clean, where with dozens of volunteers, we filled two skips
	with litter. Much of my weekend was spent pulling plastic out
	of ditches. Research from the UK shows plastic waste kills
	thousands of hedgehogs every year, no doubt it is the same in
	    Ireland.
	    "</quote></p>
	
	<p><quote>"The Green Party in Europe, particularly MEP Grace
	O'Sullivan, is working hard to ban single use plastics at
	source, but this courageous work is made difficult when the
	might of the fossil fuel companies and plastics industry are
	up against you. At home in Ireland, we’ve had the ban on
	plastic bags and now the deposit return scheme. These
	    contribute to less plastic being produced over time."
	</quote></p>
	
	<p><quote>"In the meantime, we need more support for local
	communities trying to fight pollution and waste, and I think a
	Green would help. We have no Green councillor elected in
	    Galway East, but I aim to change that."
